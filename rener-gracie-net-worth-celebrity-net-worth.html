Thus, he was literally raised on the mats of the Torrence academy, starting his training as a toddler. Gracie has spent more than twenty years on the mats at the Gracie Academy studying the art under his father Rorion and grandfather Helio's tutelage.</p><p>Having earned his black belt at the age of 19, Rener earned a reputation as a gifted teacher.

As for Rener and Ryron, they contributed to jiu-jitsu's expansion as they made the art available to everyone with Internet access or a DVD player. The two brothers set up Gracie University, the world's first interactive, online martial arts learning center that offers distance learning pckages for the Academy's proprietary courses. Nowadays, Gracie University has more than 70,000 active students across 196 countries worldwide.
