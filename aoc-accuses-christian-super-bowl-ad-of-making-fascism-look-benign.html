Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is under fire for claiming that Super Bowl ads meant to <a href=#>share Jesus Christ’s message of love</a> were trying to “make fascism look benign.”</p><p>The Bronx and Queens “Squad” Democrat went on the attack late Sunday after two commercials were aired with the tagline “He Gets Us.”</p><p>“Something tells me Jesus would not spend millions of dollars on Super Bowl ads to make fascism look benign,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AOC wrote</a> on Twitter.</p><p>The first ad that aired Sunday night urged viewers to <a href=#>be more childlike</a> and featured kids of different races embracing each other. The other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">showed images of violent confrontations</a> before displaying text reading: “Jesus loved the people we hate.”</p><p>“He gets us. All of us,” appeared at the end of both ads, which directed people to a website to learn more about Jesus’ teachings of “unconditional love” and compassion.</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet was met with a flurry of criticism on social media.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Something tells me Jesus would *not* spend millions of dollars on Super Bowl ads to make fascism look benign</p>— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href=#>February 13, 2023</a></figure><p>“Something tells me Jesus would take issue with at least some of the things you have said, done, and vote for/against,” responded Republican <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign consultant Nathan Wurtzel</a>.</p><p>“When you get really mad at the ‘don’t hate people’ ad,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quipped National Review senior writer</a> Dan McLaughlin.</p><p>“But feel free to throw a tantrum that christians [sic] mention God,” one critic wrote.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The ads urged viewers to be childlike and to love their enemies. <span class=credit>Twitter / @HeGetsUs</span></figure><p>“Love your enemy equates to Fascism?
