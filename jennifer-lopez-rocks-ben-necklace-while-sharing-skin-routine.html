My skin looks really good today,’” the “Get Right” singer boasted in the video. Lopez then revealed her secret to her dewy appearance is her <a href=#>JLo Beauty</a> <a href=#>That JLo Glow Serum</a>. “You know, some days you just have better skin than others, but I was like ‘What is it?’ and I realized for the past few days, I was really busy, and I got lazy with my skincare,” Lopez continued. “And then I just started using my Glow Serum … at night, in the morning and I did that for the past couple of days and the difference in my skin is so profound.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Hustlers star then urged her followers to try her product, saying “that with our moisturizer in the evenings and our sunscreen during the day is just a game changer.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Lopez doubled down on her public service announcement in the caption, writing: “Long set days call for consistent skincare routine … That JLo Glow Serum is my glow-to ride or die.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The “All I Have” singer’s followers praised her dazzling dermis and the serum in the comments section. “She is younger than she looks without makeup!” one fan wrote.
