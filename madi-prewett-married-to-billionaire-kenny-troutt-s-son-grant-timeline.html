The past 5 months have been the best and wildest adventure. Full of highs and lows but there’s nobody else in the world I’d rather do life with.”</p><p>Grant, for his part, gushed that he has “never met somebody that walks with such grace and beauty.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You make me smile like nobody else. You have an infectious laughter and joy about you that is so attractive to the world. You love people fiercely,” he wrote via Instagram. “You seek to honor God with all that you are. You inspire me to be better. I laugh hard with you and have also cried deeply with you. Been in some really awesome highs with you, and had some really hard moments too… you’re my first call through it all. You’re by my side. I’m so glad I met you lil Madi rose🦁😋 Hand in hand.
