Moreover, the Baton Rouge rapper recently took to Twitter to rant about the "feminine a** rap game" currently taking shape in the industry. However, unlike what your head might initially jump to, he doesn't actually have a problem with hip-hop's female exponents. Rather, he took a shot at the men who are expressing themselves in different ways- and to different degrees of concern. Equating nail polish with two brothers kissing is a stretch, but regardless, it's the stance that he expressed.</p><p>"<a href=# rel>ISLAND BOYS KISSING</a>, N***AS PAINTING THEY NAILS, BBLs smh IM SICK OF THIS Feminine A** RAP GAME!!" Boosie tweeted. "THESE MFS BOUT TO START WEARING THONGS n EYE LASHES NEXT!! N U WONDER WHY THE WOMEN TAKING OVER. CAUSE YALL TRYING TO BE THEM. N BACK OF YALL MIND SOME DAYS YALL WANNA BE H*ES, MY BAD CITY GIRLS." Furthermore, this isn't a particularly new look for the 40-year-old; not that neither novelty nor a new leaf alike excuses it, though.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>Coi Leray Retweets Boosie Badazz’s Message Of Support About “COI” First Week Sales</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-boosie-s-twitter-rant-on-the-feminine-a-rap-game>Boosie's Twitter Rant On The "Feminine A** Rap Game"</h2></span><p>Still, it seemed like Boosie was changing his ways after <a href=# rel>defending</a> <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Baby</a>'s viral picture with Michael Rubin. Said snapshot saw a lot of clowning online sprinkled with homophobic remarks, an aversion to emotion, and the usual tropes of hyper-masculinized responses to affection. <a href=# class=text-word rel>50 Cent</a> was one of many who trounced this picture. But the Louisiana native doesn't care what anyone thinks.</p><p>"I ain’t finna s**t on Lil Baby,” he said on Instagram Live. “I don’t give a f**k what picture he took. Ya’ll can get off my live with that Lil Baby s**t, I’m letting ya’ll know. Yeah, that’s my n***a. That man likes p***y. That man likes straight p***y. Say something bout Lil Baby again. B***h, I’m trying to get back on tour with Lil Baby, b***h a**, you think I’m finna say something bout Lil Baby? Get your b***h a** of my live, h*e." Sure, the comment on sexual orientation makes it backhanded, but it's a defense nonetheless. Hopefully he can take a page out of his own book, distinguish right from wrong (again, they're brothers), and come to understand and respect people's expressions.
