They have also waived their rights to spousal support and will each have their single status restored on July 9, per the docs.</p><p>Bonet <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> on Monday, January 8, two years after the estranged duo announced they had called it quits. In documents obtained by Us Weekly, the Cosby Show alum listed the couple’s date of separation as October 7, 2020, her and Momoa’s three-year wedding anniversary. She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.</p><p>Momoa and Bonet were first linked in 2005 after meeting through mutual friends. They tied the knot 13 years later in October 2017. In January 2022, they announced their separation after nearly five years of marriage.</p><p>“We have all felt the squeeze and changes of these transformational times … A revolution is unfolding ~and our family is of no exception … feeling and growing from the seismic shifts occurring,” the pair wrote in a joint Instagram statement at the time. “And so~ We share our Family news~ That we are parting ways in marriage. We share this not because we think it’s newsworthy ~ But so that~ as we go about our lives we may do so with dignity and honesty.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/feature-Jason-Momoa-and-Lisa-Bonet-.jpg><p>They continued, “We free each other ~to be who we are learning to become,” the message continued. “Our devotion unwavering to this sacred life & our Children. Teaching our Children. What’s possible ~ Living the Prayer. May Love Prevail ✨ J & L.”</p><p>Shortly after news of Momoa and Bonet’s split made headlines, a source exclusively told Us that it was the duo’s <a href=#>personality differences</a> that played a role in their split.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ajasonlisa.jpg><p>“He was jovial, loud and the center of attention, and Lisa was always cool, calm and subdued,” the insider explained. “That energy really started to cause friction because they wanted to live different lives. Jason wanted to travel and adventure much more. Lisa, she would rather read, write poetry and cook at home.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite pulling the plug on their romance, Bonet and Momoa have seemingly remained amicable in their coparenting relationship. In December 2022, the Aquaman star even delivered a Christmas tree to Bonet’s home. He’s also <a href=#>maintained a friendship</a> with Bonet’s first husband, <strong>Lenny Kravitz</strong>. The pair were married from 1987 to 19973 and share daughter Zoë Kravitz.</p><p>“Ride or die. Brothers for life,” Lenny, 59, captioned a March 2022 Instagram snap of him and Momoa riding motorcycles. Momoa, for his part, replied: “Love u bro. Ohana for life. ♥️ ♥️”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaOku265zqammmWRo7FuuMismGaan6OytXnSnqutpJVisarCzquanmVhYrGixYyana2domKzqrjIp55o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
