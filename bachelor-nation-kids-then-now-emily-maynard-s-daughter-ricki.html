Over the years, single parents have looked for love on The Bachelor or Bachelorette, often giving Bachelor Nation a glimpse at their lives with their children through the ABC show.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jason Mesnick</strong></a> was the first single dad to hand out roses as the season 13 Bachelor. He won over the hearts of fans after finishing as<a href=#><strong> DeAnna Pappas</strong></a>’ runner-up on season 4 of The Bachelorette in 2008. Mesnick’s son, Ty, from a previous marriage, briefly appeared on the show.</p><p>“I just knew that there was no way that I could truly fall in love with somebody unless they saw my son,” Mesnick said during the 2009 season.</p><p>In the end, the real estate broker proposed to <a href=#><strong>Melissa Rycroft</strong></a> but ended their engagement while the show was airing. During After the Final Rose, he reconnected with runner-up <a href=#><strong>Molly Malaney</strong></a> and they wed in 2010. Mesnick and Maloney went on to welcome daughter Riley in 2013 — <a href=#>but couldn’t escape their Bachelor past when Netflix started streaming the season in 2019.</a></p><p>“Let’s pretend YOU were The Bachelor and your 15-year-old son just discovered your season on @Neflix…” Mesnick wrote via Instagram at the time. “Do you: A.) Let him watch it? B.) Ship him off to Switzerland for a few years until it comes off Netflix.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Emily Maynard</strong></a> later became the first single mother to lead the franchise when she was named the eighth Bachelorette after winning season 15 of The Bachelor (and splitting from <a href=#><strong>Brad Womack</strong></a>). The North Carolina <a href=#>native gave birth to daughter Ricki months after her then-fiancé</a>, Ricky Hendrick, died in an airplane accident in October 2004 at 24 years old.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I wish that I would’ve kept [my time on The Bachelor and Bachelorette] totally separate [from Ricki],” Maynard said in a 2017 podcast interview. “At the time, I thought, ‘This is it,’ and I never would’ve brought her into it had I not thought that. So I wish that I maybe would’ve taken a step back. Maybe sheltered her from that a little bit more.”</p><p>Maynard didn’t find The One on The Bachelorette, but she married <a href=#><strong>Tyler Johnson</strong></a> in 2014 and welcomed four more kids: Jennings, Gibson, Gatlin and Magnolia.</p><p>It hasn’t only been leads who have opened up about their kids on the show, however.
