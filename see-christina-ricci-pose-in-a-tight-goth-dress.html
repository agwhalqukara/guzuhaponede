When the actress gets all dolled up for an event, she often strikes a few poses in what seems the garden steps of her home, surrounded by lush foliage. Despite all of the lush plant life, Christina Ricci still manages to pull off an <a href=#>Addams</a>-like goth look.</p><p>Christina Ricci is as much of a fashionista as she is an actress and has frequently proved that she can look great in <a href=#>any color</a>, not just the cool black favored by her breakout role, Wednesday Addams. The actress has actually gone so far as to say she has never actually been a goth, despite her reputation for playing dark and unusual characters (like, say, the most self-assured and intimidating child in history).&nbsp;</p><p>For this particular occasion, Christina Ricci wore a jet-black, tightly-fitted gown by Galvan London. The dress has a velvet texture and a cutaway that leaves her left shoulder and arm completely bare. On her left wrist, she is wearing a silver bracelet, while her earrings are vividly purple stones; both the bracelet and earrings were provided by Martin Katz Jewels, according to the caption of Ricci’s posts.</p><p>In fact, Christina Ricci took great care to credit all of her style team in the caption to her <a href=#>Instagram</a> post; her hair was by Stephen Beaver, while her dark, shimmering makeup was by Allen Avendano. While Ricci is an undeniable natural beauty, it takes a village to put together a stylish look like this one.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/christina-ricci-yellowjackets-900x507.jpg><p>Currently, Christina Ricci stars in the critically acclaimed Showtime series Yellowjackets as the adult version of Misty Quigly, an eerily cheerful nurse and fan of show tunes who is almost definitely a sociopath and probable serial killer. The first season of the show currently holds a perfect 100% Critics score on Rotten Tomatoes, which has raised a lot of expectations for the <a href=#>upcoming season 2</a>.</p><p>Yellowjackets is set in two different time periods: the mid-90s, when a group of champion soccer players crashes in the Canadian wilderness while flying to a tournament, and the modern day, when the adult survivors find themselves unwillingly brought back together. Christina Ricci’s Misty (played as a teen by Sammi Hanratty) is the equipment manager of the team and the most competent in medical skills but also appears to be both delusional and willing to drug the object of her affection to make him dependent on her.</p><p><br>Yellowjackets season 2 will premiere on March 26 and co-stars Melanie Lynskey, Juliette Lewis, and Sophie Thatcher. In addition to that wildly anticipated show, Christina Ricci is currently starring as fan-favorite DC Comics character Dr. Harleen Quinzel in the <a href=#>narrative podcast</a> Harley Quinn & The Joker: Sound Mind. Even if Christina Ricci claims she has never been a goth, she has to admit she has a knack for some pretty disturbing roles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnk52%2Fqr%2FToqWaZaKesKS1jK2goKCkYrSwwMdmm6udo6h7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
