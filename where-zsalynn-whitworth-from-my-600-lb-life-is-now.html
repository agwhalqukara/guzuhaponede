And she relied on it when things got tough. Zsalynn was able to qualify for Dr. Now's program and received gastric bypass surgery, eventually losing 316 pounds. That weight loss made her eligible for skin removal surgery, per <a href=#>Starcasm</a>, and though she was worried about the surgery, she did go through with it, and lost another 52 pounds of skin. Her total weight loss was 378 pounds. She also shed the weight of her problematic husband, Gareth, when they finally got a divorce (can we say thank goodness?).</p><p>But Zsalynn still had challenges ahead of her. She struggled with depression when she had to share custody of her daughter Hannah, per <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>. She felt lonely when Hannah was not around, and it was difficult not to give in to sweets and unhealthy foods as a way of dealing with the depression.</p><p>Fortunately, with help from a therapist, Zsalynn has continued her journey, while also remaining an ambassador for body positivity, and she appears much happier now. She loves dogs, and shares photos of them as well as her daughter Hannah on her social media accounts, from <a href=#>Twitter</a> and <a href=#>Facebook</a> to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to&nbsp;<a href=#>TikTok</a>. She has even found a new love. She has a compassionate new partner named Jack Lapp, and <a href=#>they look like</a> a wonderfully supportive team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWliboF2e9ahnKudXa%2FAorjYp6Vmr5iewbi70a2fZp6ipLpuudhmbWloXaGvbrjIn5xmoaNiu7DDjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
