The beach looked like the&nbsp;perfect place to say 'I do', with white sand, a clear blue ocean and a giant heart situated in the sand. Jennifer even tagged fianc√© Alex Rodriguez in the video. The star is currently travelling the world on her It's My Party tour, so while it's unlikely that they will get married anytime soon, it may well be the perfect place for them when they eventually say their vows.</p><p style=text-align:center id=eTEw7wzukfs data-wc=11><strong>Jennifer Lopez shared a photo of a wedding location on Instagram</strong></p><p id=eu9QxQER80X data-wc=66>Fans adore Jennifer and Alex's relationship, and the pair often share snippets of their family life on social media. They both have their own YouTube channels, and have been documenting life behind-the-scenes throughout Jennifer's tour. The pair have four children between them, with Jennifer sharing 11-year-old-twins Max and Emme with ex-husband Marc Anthony, while Alex shares daughters Natasha, 14, and Ella, 11, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/85681ac36ba9-jennifer-lopez-wedding-hint-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eKo5-7VgohW data-wc=7><strong>Jennifer and Alex got engaged in March</strong></p><p id=e8xjhyClAXn data-wc=1><strong>READ: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Meghan Markle received a surprise birthday cake in Windsor</a></p><p id=eguXlxjjamNf data-wc=116>Alex and Jennifer announced their engagement in March, and both shared the same picture of Alex holding Jennifer's left hand to show off her impressive diamond on her ring finger. Alex wrote: "She said yes," while Jennifer simply posted a row of heart emojis. The day before their engagement, Alex had shared a quote on Instagram Stories about soulmates, which read: "A soulmate isn't someone who completes you. No, a soulmate is someone who inspires you to complete yourself. A soulmate is someone who loves you with so much conviction, and so much heart, that it is nearly impossible to doubt just how capable you are of becoming exactly who you have always wanted to be."</p><p id=enHnXXRhkAAb data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Sarah Ferguson shares never-before-seen photos of Princess Beatrice on her birthday</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a4ba58a4ecda-jennifer-lopez-alex-z.jpg><p id=euX_KVi7y3uB data-wc=54>The future wedding will, quite literally, make Alex's dreams come true. In June, the former baseball star shared an old MLB Network video clip on Instagram from 1998, where he was asked by a reporter who his dream date would be. He replied: "Jennifer Lopez. Hopefully you can find me a date with her."&nbsp;</p><p id=e8JgR8MoKBPK data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
