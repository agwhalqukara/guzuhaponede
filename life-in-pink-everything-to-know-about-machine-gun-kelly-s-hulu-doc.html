The last time I heard from him I was like, ‘I love you so much and I’m so sorry for how we lived this life together. We’ll do it better on the next one.’”</p><p>The <a href=#>Good Mourning</a> actor previously explained how <a href=#>he uses projects to work through his personal issues.</a></p><p>“Because of the way that I grew up, I kind of push away everybody and every situation that has a positive outcome because I just kind of perceive myself as unworthy or low or undeserving and that’s been implemented since childhood. I’m learning a lot more about my childhood now and why I’m made like that,” he detailed during a June 2022 panel for his movie Taurus. “I have a real problem accepting happiness and it’s healthy watching it on screen to remind yourself like, ‘OK yeah, you don’t want to end up like that guy.’ I always have a weird way of writing things on paper that come true.”</p><p>At the time, Kelly received support from fiancée <a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a>, who <a href=#>appears in many of his films</a>. “You can’t receive the gifts that God’s trying to give you if your hands are closed. You have to open your hands,” the actress told him on stage.</p><p>The couple <a href=#>started dating in 2020 after meeting on the set</a> of Midnight in the Switchgrass. After less than two years together, Kelly and Fox <a href=#>announced their engagement.</a></p><p>“In July of 2020 we sat under this banyan tree. We asked for magic,” the Jennifer’s Body star, who was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Brian Austin Green</strong></a>, captioned an Instagram<a href=#> video of the proposal</a> in January 2022. “We were oblivious to the pain we would face together in such a short, frenetic period of time. Unaware of the work and sacrifices the relationship would require from us but intoxicated off of the love. And the karma.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fox added: “Somehow a year and a half later, having walked through hell together, and having laughed more than I ever imagined possible, he asked me to marry him. And just as in every lifetime before this one, and as in every lifetime that will follow it, I said yes.”</p><p>Scroll down or everything we know about Kelly’s Life in Pink documentary:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BhtqexjKKlZqiZo7husdWeqbKsmJ67qHnTqGSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqWRmLWqusRmnq6mXaCyrbjYrGShrZyqeqW7wmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
