A very brief&nbsp;<a href=#>YouTube teaser trailer</a> for the documentary was released on November 8, 2022. It features <a href=#>a very pained-looking Casey</a> on camera being interviewed and asked the question, "Why talk to me now when you're not getting creative control?" by someone off-screen. Casey Anthony doesn't speak at all during the trailer, but she did provide plenty of non-verbal communication, so we had Ponce, a body language expert, take a careful look at what she did during the 60-second trailer. As it turns out, she did a lot. "Casey is definitely nervous,"&nbsp;he told Grunge.&nbsp;"It is like watching someone who just got on the witness stand and is about to testify."</p><p>There are a few more things to note from the teaser as well: there is a mixture of both anxiety and resolve here. Ponce explained that her fashion signifies both professionalism and polish, though they alone cannot hide some clear-cut signs of inner struggle. According to&nbsp;Carolyn Mair, Ph.D., a fashion psychology expert who was a guest on a podcast for the <a href=#>American Psychological Association</a>&nbsp;(APA), fashion can say a lot about a person. "The clothes we put on every day tell a story about who we are to the world and can have a major impact on our emotions and mood," Dr. Mair said. This psychology could help explain the inherent divide between what Casey's clothes say vs. what her body says.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j3Jtam9lZK%2BwsNhmo5qml6quqLGMnq%2BpnaKperWxy6WqZq2jYrWww4ycmKydqWKur8DHqKWyq12kwrXDwKubZpmgpbKivsCnmp5lmah6qbXDoqWgZZmju6a%2BjK2sq6Wfnrlw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
