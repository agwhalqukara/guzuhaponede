Jonah White grew up very poor. He did not always have shoes, and his family ate roadkill in order to have meat on the table. He moved to Illinois with his mother and father in a school bus when he was in his early teens, and after graduating from high school, he intended to focus on a career in football. However, professional football did not happen, so he lived in a cave for a year, and tried to figure out what to do with his life. He came up with an idea for novelty fake teeth. Without a way to manufacture his idea, he ended up pretending to be a student at the Southern Illinois University School of Dental Medicine, so that he could use their lab to build prototypes. He eventually partnered with Rich Bailey, another entrepreneur, and they now own Billy Bob Teeth, a massively successful novelty and gag toy supplier. Jonah White now lives on 900 acres in Calhoun County, Illinois with his family. He was the subject of the reality television special, "Billy Bob's Gags to Riches" on the Discovery Channel.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-355714 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Jonah-White.jpg alt width=900 height=1350 sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-355714 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by JONATHON ZIEGLER/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wp6mrGeapLuitIywn6KslWK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
