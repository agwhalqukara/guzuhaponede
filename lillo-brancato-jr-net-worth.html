This led to Brancato's first major acting role, starring in De Niro's 1993 directorial debut, "A Bronx Tale." He played Calogero 'C' Anello, the teenaged son of De Niro's character Lorenzo. Brancato had his next role in <a href=# title="Penny Marshall Net Worth">Penny Marshall</a>'s 1994 comedy "Renaissance Man," playing Private Donnie Benitez.

The film was his last before being charged in 2005 for murder and burglary.

He landed his biggest television role the next year on the HBO series "The Sopranos," playing young mobster Matthew Bevilaqua during the show's second season. Brancato also played a mobster in an episode of the short-lived CBS series "Falcone." He later appeared in an episode of the police procedural series "NYPD Blue."</p><h2 id=legal-troubles><strong>Legal Troubles</strong></h2><p>Shortly after beginning his acting career in the early 1990s, Brancato started using drugs. By his mid-20s, he had become addicted to cocaine and heroin. In June of 2005, Brancato was arrested in Yonkers, New York, originally for having a rear brake light out. However, upon inspection of the vehicle, police found four bags of heroin. Brancato was consequently charged with a seventh-degree Class A misdemeanor for criminal possession of a controlled substance. He got into even greater legal trouble six months later, on December 10, when he was arrested in the Bronx for the murder of police officer Daniel Enchautegui during an attempted burglary. Enchautegui was off-duty at the time, and confronted Brancato and another man when he found them breaking into a vacant house next to his own. The officer was shot and killed in a gunfight that erupted while he was awaiting backup.</p><p>After the shooting, it was determined that the shot that killed Enchautegui came from Brancato's accomplice, Steven Armento, who was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. For his part in the incident, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder. In December of 2008, a jury found him not guilty of murder, but still guilty of first-degree attempted burglary. The next month, Brancato was sentenced to 10 years in prison. While behind bars, he continued abusing drugs, and at least once had a heroin overdose. On New Year's Eve in 2013, Brancato was released on parole after having served close to five years of his sentence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLmquMuoZJuqkaOwosDOZqGrZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
