It’s the perfect track to start with, as the four deliver incredible harmonies and show off some of the arm movements which have become a tradition during TT’s&nbsp;live shows.</p><p>James then talks about Take That being a three piece, jokingly asking who will be the next to leave. He also revealed how much of a superfan of the manband he is, stating “as a Take That fan, being in this car is unreal for me.” This leads beautifully into ‘Greatest Day’, once again complete with the infamous arm movements.</p><p>Sandwiched before and after a rendition of ‘Babe’, there&nbsp;was plenty of banter to be had in the car, including James admiring Howard’s shape. The four then burst into ‘Giants’, Take That’s latest single.</p><p>One of the standout parts was ‘Never Forget’, complete with the arm movements which have become synonymous with the song. Whilst ‘Never Forget’ normally signals the end of a TT concert, there was still plenty of fun to be had during this Carpool.</p><p>After more singalongs and even more banter, James decided that it was time for Take That to finally break America. He took to the streets to spread the word about the trio – cue&nbsp;dance moves, pep talks and their first&nbsp;performance at a store in LA!</p><p>Check out Take That’s Carpool Karaoke below.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Take That were incredibly good sports, and James appeared to be loving every second in the company of his favourite manband. We loved the harmonies, synchronised dance moves and the hilarity provided by the four. The fact that James is also such a huge TT fan made it all the more enjoyable. Thank you James and Take That for delivering one of our favourite Carpool Karaokes EVER!</p><p>Of course, whilst this Carpool Karaoke gave us plenty of laughs and smiles, we must also remember that this special edition&nbsp;is in aid of Comic Relief.
