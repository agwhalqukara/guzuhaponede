On October 22, 2023, authorities were alerted to the absence of Kadence Brown, and subsequently, a missing person report was filed for Jacob Lara. The search for the two missing teenagers led to a heart-wrenching discovery in a Tulsa parking lot.</p><p>Police investigations revealed that the two missing 17-year-olds were last seen together near 21st and Yale. Later that day, a distressing call reported an unattended death in the parking lot at 1869 S. Yale Avenue. Friends of the adolescents shared that they had observed one of the missing teenagers driving a gray 2013 Dodge Charger in the parking lot of a Dunkin’ Donuts, raising concerns about their well-being.</p><p>Scott Martin posted on Facebook,</p><p>This story just hurts my heart. Today, Jacob Lara, 17 will be laid to rest. Kadence Brown’s funeral is next week. They were both found dead in car near 21st and Yale. We talked with Jacob’s sister last night. She says he was the light of their world.<br>Tulsa Police say a preliminary report from the medical examiner, shows they died from carbon monoxide poisoning.</p><p>Tragically, the bodies of Kadence Brown and Jacob Lara were found inside the vehicle. Preliminary assessments by the Office of the Medical Examiner suggest that carbon monoxide poisoning is the likely cause of their deaths. Collaborative efforts between the Tulsa Fire Department, Tulsa Police Department detectives, and technicians from the City of Tulsa’s Asset Management Division are underway to thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragic incident.</p><p>Authorities emphasized the importance of installing carbon monoxide detectors, which helped determine that the passenger compartment of the vehicle had been exposed to potentially lethal levels of the gas while the vehicle was idling. While the investigation remains ongoing, the Office of the Medical Examiner is expected to provide a comprehensive report in the near future, shedding more light on the incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kuKKwxKeanmWSp7y4uoyapZ1lmpawsK6MpZirmV2bvLa6w2abnpmUYravedOuo6yZXaWus7fIp55mpJ%2BpfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
