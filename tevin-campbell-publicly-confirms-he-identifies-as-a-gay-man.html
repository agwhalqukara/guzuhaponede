But a lot of us do …&nbsp; and the fact that I’ve embraced me.”</p><p>Campbell explained that it wasn’t so much that he concealed his sexuality from those around him, he just felt it wasn’t accepted to be gay in the music industry early on in his career.</p><p>“I didn’t hide anything about me. I didn’t try to act a certain way or anything,” he said. “You just couldn’t be [gay] back then.”</p><p>In 2005, Tevin Campbell starred as&nbsp;Seaweed J. Stubbs in the Broadway musical&nbsp;Hairspray; it was during this time he felt like he’d truly found himself.</p><p>“Being around people who were like me, LGBTQ+ people that were living normal lives and had partners. I had never seen that,” he said. “That was a great time in my life.”</p><p>The singer also heaped praise on the likes of <a class=underline-link href=#>Frank Ocean</a> and <a class=underline-link href=#>Lil Nas X</a>, who have found huge success in music while also being openly queer.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2021/09/210905-Lil-Nas-X-e1633613452527.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Lil Nas X Proclaims The Change Of Hip Hop: 'There's Gonna Be So Many Gay Rappers'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>November 16, 2021</p></a><p>“It wasn’t like that in the ’90s, but I’m glad I get to see it. I’m glad that’s changing,” Campbell said. “There are a lot of kids, especially young Black boys that need to see representation. They’re not being taught to love themselves because of who they are.”</p><p>Tevin Campbell released his platinum-selling debut, T.E.V.I.N., in 1991 and followed it up with 1993’s I’m Ready, which produced the No. 1 single “Can We Talk.” That album went on to be certified double-platinum by the RIAA.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Throughout the ’90s, the young musical prodigy remained a mainstay on the R&B charts. His 1999 self-titled LP was his&nbsp;last full-length project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZnZ4Rzfo6toK2klWPBpsLIp2ScmZ2lr6a4y2aemrFdobSjwNBmmqillah6sMHTZqafnpmYtqK4y7I%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
