The winning bid? $16.55 million.</p><p>Resort magnate Steve Wynn knows a thing or two about finding just the rich combination of beauty and comfort, as is evident by the 11,027-square-foot mansion he has kept in his fold for many years. But a buyer with just the right amount of cash is enough to send the business enterprise tycoon packing. Records show that the founder and chief of Wynn Resorts scooped up the Bel Air home three years ago for $16.25 million, meaning that the $16.55 million sale he just closed on actually netted the billionaire some pocket change. Regardless, the buyers – a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon and neurosurgeon, according to the LA Times –&nbsp;have a modern masterpiece and some killer views to enjoy. Take a peek below.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-217283 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1-Marc-Tiffany-AngelesUnlimited-Style-Real-Estate-Photography.jpg alt width=900 height=506 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-217283 class=wp-caption-text>Marc & Tiffany Angeles/Unlimited Style Real Estate Photography</p><p>Built in 1991, the just sold modern Mediterranean style home is tucked behind a private gate and is not far from the Bel Air Country Club. In total, the spacious estate offers five bedrooms and eight bathrooms. Past the palm tree-lined drive is the large motor court, just feet from the mansion's double front doors. In total, the property&nbsp;tops out at one acre, including such amenities as an indoor gym with a sauna and steam room, private putting green, an outdoor swimming pool and spa, and decorative waterfalls.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-217281 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Marc-Tiffany-AngelesUnlimited-Style-Real-Estate-Photography-2.jpg alt width=900 height=506 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-217281 class=wp-caption-text>Marc & Tiffany Angeles/Unlimited Style Real Estate Photography</p><p>The first sight beyond the home's entryway is this: a large, sweeping double staircase in the foyer, complete with a royal chandelier, high vaulted ceiling, and access into the full first floor layout. The spacious and formal setup includes a family room complete with its own wet bar, a wood-paneled private study, a personalized media room, a formal living room, an in-home gym, and a complete chef's kitchen. The formal living room is encased with mirrored walls and features a large fireplace, while the gym boasts its own sauna and steam room.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-217282 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Marc-Tiffany-AngelesUnlimited-Style-Real-Estate-Photography-3.jpg alt width=900 height=506 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-217282 class=wp-caption-text>Marc & Tiffany Angeles/Unlimited Style Real Estate Photography</p><p>Upstairs is where you'll find five bedrooms, each with their own private bathroom. The most impressive of the lot is the spacious master suite, which includes walk-in closets, generous views, and its own private balcony&nbsp;which in and of itself leads to a personalized view of the city's nearby golf course and beyond, one of the home's many beautiful vantage points.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-217280 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Marc-Tiffany-AngelesUnlimited-Style-Real-Estate-Photography-4.jpg alt width=900 height=506 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-217280 class=wp-caption-text>Marc & Tiffany Angeles/Unlimited Style Real Estate Photography</p><p>Back downstairs and past the glass pocket doors on the main level you'll find a mixture of pristine terraces and al fresco dining and entertaining areas perfect for an indoor-outdoor living environment. Following the stairs from the large, circular patio down, there is a large pool complete with waterfalls. Beyond that, additional lounge spots sit tucked among the shaped shrubbery, a personal putting green not far beyond that, and an active koi pond tops off the list of the backyard's most eye-catching extras.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-217274 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GettyImages-456422324.jpg alt width=900 height=655 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-217274 class=wp-caption-text>Ethan Miller/Getty Images</p><p>Steve Wynn, 75, is an American casino resort and real estate developer with a net worth of <a href=#>$3.6 billion</a>.
